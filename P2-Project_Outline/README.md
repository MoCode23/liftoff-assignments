# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This app will provide a list of "safe homes" that are available to contact by at risk LGBT youth. The idea came out of compassion for the LGBT community and because of the rise of teens that find themselves homeless because their parents don't agree with their sexual orientation or gender affiliation. I feel that the targeted user of this app will find it useful because it can help them back on their feet if they need to find a place to stay.

The user of this app can take solice in the fact that no one is going to judge them because of what gender they like or identify as. The user will be free to contact the safe home and speak with the homeowner directly. The homeowner can sign in and upload or delete their home from the list. 
### Features
Homeowner login: Homeowners will be able to create accounts and log in to the application.
Safe Home listing: Homeowners will be able to post their zip code and contact information.
Search: Users will be able to search for safe homes by zip code. The homes in that area will show as a list.
### Technologies
Java
HTML
Spring Boot
MySQL
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to properly configue the database so that only the homeowners have logins and have access to only the zip code and contact information they enter in.
